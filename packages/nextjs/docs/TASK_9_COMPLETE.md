# Task 9: Update Header Component - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully updated the header component with glassmorphism design, enhanced CivicAuthButton with dropdown menu, and improved accessibility.

## Changes Made

### 9.1 CivicAuthButton Enhancement ✅

#### Glassmorphism Dropdown Menu
- Replaced simple sign-out button with sophisticated dropdown menu
- Applied glassmorphism effects using `glass-card` and `glass-hover` classes
- Added smooth transitions and animations (300ms duration)
- Implemented outside-click detection to close dropdown

#### User Information Display
- **Dropdown Header**: Shows user name, email, and full wallet address
- **Compact Button**: Shows abbreviated wallet address (6...4 format)
- **Responsive**: Hides name on small screens (sm:block)
- **Visual Feedback**: Chevron icon rotates when dropdown opens

#### Accessibility Improvements

- Keyboard accessible with proper focus management

#### Enhanced Styling
- **Button**: `glass-hover` effect with shadow on hover
- **Dropdown**: `glass-card` with rounded corners and shadow
- **Sign Out Button**: Hover effect with semi-transparent background
- **Transitions**: Smooth animations for all interactive elements

### 9.2 Connect Wallet Button Enhancement ✅

#### Glassmorphism Effects
- Added shadow effects: `shadow-md hover:shadow-lg`
- Enhanced transitions: `transition-all duration-300`
- Improved focus states: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary focus:ring-offset-2`
