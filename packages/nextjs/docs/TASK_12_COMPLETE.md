### 2. Semantic HTML Usage ✅
**Requirement 14.2: Ensure semantic HTML usage**

#### Implementation Details

### 3. ARIA Labels ✅
**Requirement 14.3: Add ARIA labels where needed**

#### Implementation Details
- Added descriptive ARIA labels to all icon-only buttons
- Implemented dynamic ARIA labels for state changes
- Added ARIA relationships between elements

#### ARIA Attributes Added

**Button Component:**
- `aria-disabled` attribute when disabled
- Explicit `type` attribute (defaults to "button")

**Input Component:**
- `aria-invalid` for error states

### 4. Keyboard Navigation ✅
**Requirement 14.4: Test keyboard navigation**

#### Implementation Details
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Proper tab order maintained

- Escape key support for closing dropdowns

#### Keyboard Support
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate through interactive elements
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons and links
- **Escape**: Close dropdowns (via useOutsideClick hook)
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate within menus (native browser behavior)

#### Focus Management
- Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
- Logical tab order throughout application
- Focus trapped appropriately in dropdowns
- Focus returns to trigger after dropdown closes

### 5. Screen Reader Compatibility ✅
**Requirement 14.5: Verify screen reader compatibility**

#### Implementation Details
- Proper ARIA attributes for screen reader context
- Semantic HTML for better screen reader navigation
- Hidden decorative elements from screen readers
- Live regions for dynamic content

#### Screen Reader Optimizations
- **Decorative Icons**: Marked with `aria-hidden="true"`
- **Alternative Text**: Provided for meaningful images
- **Error Messages**: Announced with `role="alert"`
- **State Changes**: Communicated via `aria-expanded`, `aria-invalid`
- **Relationships**: Established via `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`
- **Current Page**: Indicated with `aria-current="page"`
